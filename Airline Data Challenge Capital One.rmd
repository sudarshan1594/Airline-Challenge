# Airline Data Challenge Problem Statement

An airline company is looking to enter the United States domestic market.Specifically,the company has decided to start with 5 round trip routes between medium and large US airports. An example of a round trip route is the combination of JFK to ORD and ORD to JFK. The airline company has to acquire 5 new airplanes (one per round trip route) and the upfront cost for each airplane is $90 million. Identifying the 5 best routes based on factors like occupancy rates, number of flights operating etc is the goal of the project.

Findings: 

1. With ~25,000 flights WN(southwest airlines) operates the most number of flights in a week.
2. MN(Envoy air or american eagle) operates ~5000 flights on an average per week. They have one of the highest flight cancellations at 15% in a given week on week 5. This figure is followed by OH(Pacific Southwest) with a 10% cancellation rate on week 8
3. OO(Sky west) has both, the highest avg arrival delay ~20 min in week 6 and highest avg departure delays ~25 min in weeks 4 and 6.
4. UA(United) tops the chart with avg distance covered with covering avg distance 1100+ miles every week.

# Analysis of the final data set

Assumptions

The following assumptions from the PDF given for direction are taken into account during the analysis

1. capacity 200 for all the flights which is constant.
2. 50% passengers have check-in luggage.
3. No seasonality. Demand is constant
4. Also as mentioned before,  apart from difference in arrival and departure delays in origin and destination, other variables like distance, round trip cost are the same. So, only one row is used.

```
Findings
1. Less 500 flights are operated between 2258 of the 2828 round trip routes. Also, 86 routes just have less than 10 trips.
2. High correlation is seen between the arrival and departure delay at both origin and destination
3. From the histogram of profits, we can see not all round trip routes are operating with a profit.216 routes are operating with a loss.
4. Avg Occupancy rate of most routes are at 65%
5. For every round trip route there at most 50% of high occupancy percentage. i.e. At-most 50% of the flights operated between any routes have an occupancy rate of >=75%

top_n_bar( reporting_dataset %>% filter(number_of_flights >= 10),Route,profit,10, "Top 10 Profitable Routes","Route","Profit")
top_n_table( reporting_dataset %>% filter(number_of_flights >= 10),profit,10,"Top 10 Profitable Routes")

## 3. Recommendations on investing in top routes
 
We will be taking into account various factors to choose the routes to invest in. So we will be making use of quartiles of various metrics to arrive at the recommendation. We will be recommending routes that fall in the first quartile of average occupancy rate, first quartile of avg high occupancy percentage,
first quartile of number of flights operated in that route and bottom three quartiles of avg delays(arrival and departure delays of origin and departure summed up)(keeping bottom quartile alone did not fetch the required records)

```{r}
flights_to_invest_in <- reporting_dataset %>% 
  mutate(quartile_number_of_flights = ntile(number_of_flights, 4),
         quartile_avg_occupancy_rate = ntile(avg_occupancy_rate, 4),
         quartile_high_occupancy_percentage = ntile(high_occupancy_percentage, 4),
         quartile_profit = ntile(profit, 4),
         quartile_delays = ntile(avg_arr_delay_origin_capped+avg_dep_delay_origin_capped+avg_arr_delay_destination_capped+avg_dep_delay_destination_capped, 4))  %>%
    filter(quartile_number_of_flights == 4 & quartile_avg_occupancy_rate == 4 & quartile_high_occupancy_percentage == 4 & quartile_profit == 4 & (quartile_delays == 1 |quartile_delays == 2 |quartile_delays == 3))

top_n_table(flights_to_invest_in,Route,6,"Routes to Invest In")
```

## 4. Number of Round trips taken to break even airplane cost of $90 million

Also, calculating the time required to break even assuming daily round trips for all the routes

```{r}
flights_to_invest_in <- flights_to_invest_in %>% mutate(round_trips_taken_to_break_even = round(90000000/profit,0),
             years_to_break_even = round(90000000/(profit*7*4*12),0))

top_n_table(flights_to_invest_in,Route,6,"Reccommended Routes to Invest In")

top_n_bar(flights_to_invest_in,Route,round_trips_taken_to_break_even,6, "Round trips it will take to break even","Route","Round Trips")
top_n_bar(flights_to_invest_in,Route,years_to_break_even,6, "Years it will take to break even","Route","Years")

flights_to_invest_in %>%
              summarise(avg_round_trips=mean(number_of_flights),
                        avg_profit=mean(profit),
                        avg_round_trips_to_break_even=mean(round_trips_taken_to_break_even),
                        avg_years_to_break_even = mean(years_to_break_even))
```

### Insights

On these six recommended routes 497 flights are operated on an average with an average profit of $49,390.It will take the business average of 1880 routes to be operated on these routes. Assuming that, there are 1 daily round trips are operated on these routes with 7 flights a week, it will take 5.8 years years to break-even on flight costs of all these routes.
This set of routes are recommended with a view on reducing the risks of low occupancy rate, low occupancy percentage and high delays and increasing the profits. Recommendations will differ if the business wants to opt for a different strategy. Based on the strategic preferences of the business the metrics used to arrive at these recommendations can be tweaked to created a weighted score metric and a different set of routes could be proposed based on that weighted score metric.

## 5. KPIs to be tracked
To gauge the success of our selected route set we should track the following KPIs

Operating cost - 
In real world operating costs tend to fluctuate. Tracking this will helps understand the factors influencing the costs such as jet fuel expenses , labor costs. It will also help us identify those factors affecting operating costs which was previously not taken into consideration.

Occupancy rate -
Occupancy rates need to be tracked and bench marked against average occupancy rates of other airlines in the same routes. Low occupancy rates could be indicative of 
poor airline performance

Average arrival and departure delays
Delay free air travel is what everyone aims for. Departure and arrival delay can increase operating costs and also reduce customer satisfaction. Reasons for delay can also be added to see if external factors like weather, airport constructions are effecting performances.

Ticket prices
Dynamic pricing is followed in airline industry and tracking average round trip prices of competitors will help us price our tickets in an optimum manner and help us position our services and attract appropriate customers.

Market share vs Demand
Market share helps us understand how much of the demand are we catering to. This can be analyzed with occupancy rate to see if we are capturing targeted market share.
We could also use other airlines market share to identify if the demand is more than the supply so that frequency in the routes can be increased.

Total Ticket Bookings:
We can track the total tickets booked and measure it against cancelled tickets and the occupancy of the routes

Cancellation rates:
This can be monitored and benchmark against cancellations across all the careers to assess aircraft performance 

In addition to these metrics, revenue and profit can be tracked too

# Next Steps


1. Using the KPIs that have been suggested, we need to track the performance of airlines on these routes 
and closely follow demand and fluctuations in demand. By knowing the fluctuations in demand we can alter our schedules and if there are routes which are 
operating in losses, new routes should be identified based on current demand by using a pivot strategy. 
2. Taking seasonality into account will help us make an better informed decision in better scheduling our routes and the frequency of these routes.We also closely need to monitor our competitors in these routes by tracking the frequency of their operations in these routes. Gathering competitor data can help us identify new demands, new customer segments and new markets that have still not been tapped and use it to our advantage in making decisions.
3. Fuel is a very big cost component of operating cost. We need to start gathering data points that affect fuel consumption such airport elevation, average load of the aircraft, average optimum flying altitude of aircraft in these routes to better predict the fuel consumption and forecast operating costs efficiently.
4. We can use the total ticket bookings data and compare them against cancellations and occupancy rate of routes to see if we are utilizing the maximum possible over booking threshold and maximize our profits. If bookings are scares but the demand is high, we need to devise an customer acquisition strategy to attract more customers
